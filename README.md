<summary align="center"><h2>FAQ</h2></summary>


### Can I use this on a mobile device or an iPad?
I would generally recommend a computer. You can probably use mobile devices (google it).<br>

### Will these ban you?
You can be banned by exceeding the ratelimit. All of our scripts are specially tailored to PREVENT this from happening.<br>

### Will these be taken down?
Unless I am asked by Xotic, these will stay on Github and be regularly maintained.<br>

### Why are these obfuscated?
Skids are rather annoying. Deobfuscators are also annoying.<br>

### My school blocked inspect, what do I do?
Try [this](https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/) tool. In other words, use the "bookmarklet method".
